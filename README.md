# Graphical-Convolutional-Network
The task is to find classes of nodes of a citation network given the citation links between some documents.The data set being 
used  is CiteSeer which consists of bag of words and citation links.
There are a total 6 classes of which each document can belong to.
Using a graphical convulational network with pyTorch geometric module, the model is formed and trained on the dataset.
Finally a test and validation accuracy of about 80% is achieved and plotted.
